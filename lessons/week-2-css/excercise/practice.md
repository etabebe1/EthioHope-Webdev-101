## 🧱 Your Page Must Include:

1. A big title using an `<h1>` tag
2. A paragraph describing something you like
3. A `<div>` with a `class` (like `info-box` or `fun-box`)
4. Inside the `<div>`, add:

   - A small heading `<h2>`
   - A list `<ul>` of at least 3 things you enjoy (food, games, hobbies, etc.)

5. A button that says **"Click Me!"**

## 🎨 Style It With CSS

- Set a fun **background color** for the body
- Change the **text color** of headings and paragraphs
- Style the list items with a different **font** and some **spacing**

Then in CSS:

```css
body {
  font-family: 'Comic Neue', cursive;
}
```
