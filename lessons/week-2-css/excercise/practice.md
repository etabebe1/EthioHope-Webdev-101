# ✅ Week 2 Practice Exercise: My Favorite Hobby Card 🧑‍🎨

## 🎯 Goal

Create a fun and colorful **info card** about your favorite hobby — like painting, soccer, baking, reading, or anything else you love!

You will:

- Structure your card using **HTML**
- Style it with **CSS** using everything you’ve learned
- Practice working with the **box model**, **fonts**, **colors**, **borders**, and **hover effects**

---

## 📁 Files to Create

- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- One **image file** related to your hobby  
  (e.g., `book.jpg`, `ball.png`, etc.)

---

## 🧱 Your Hobby Card Must Include

Inside a `<div>`, include:

- A **heading (`<h2>`)** — the name of your hobby
- An **image (`<img>`)** — a picture of your hobby
- A **short paragraph (`<p>`)** — describe why you enjoy it
- A **button (`<button>`)** — that says something like “See More” or “Try It!”

---

## 🎨 Style It With CSS

- Give your card a **background color** and **border**
- Add **padding** and **rounded corners**
- Center the content using `text-align: center`
- Style the **button** and add a **hover effect**
- Use a **Google Font** to make it look awesome
- Give the **image** a nice size and `border-radius` for rounded edges

---

## ⭐ Bonus Challenge

- Add a **second card** for another hobby
- Make the layout look like a **mini hobby gallery!**

## 🏁 When You’re Done

Your page should show off something you really love in a creative, colorful way.
