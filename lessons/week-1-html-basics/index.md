## 🔤 HTML Tags You’ll Learn (with Definitions)

These are the building blocks of every web page. Let’s learn what each tag does and how to use them:

### `<!DOCTYPE html>`

- Tells the browser this is an HTML5 document.
- Helps the browser understand how to read your code.

### `<html>`

- Wraps all the content on your web page.
- Every HTML document starts with `<html>` and ends with `</html>`.

### `<head>`

- Holds information _about_ the page (not shown on the page).
- Used for title, links to CSS, and metadata.

### `<body>`

- Contains everything that shows up on the actual webpage.
- Example: text, images, links, lists, etc.

### `<h1>` to `<h6>`

- Headings from largest (`<h1>`) to smallest (`<h6>`).
- Use them to create titles and subtitles.

### `<p>`

- Adds a paragraph of text.
- Great for writing descriptions or content.

### `<a>`

- Adds a clickable link.
- Syntax: `<a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>`

### `<img>`

- Displays an image.
- Syntax: `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">`

### `<ul>` and `<ol>`

- `<ul>` = Unordered list (bullets)
- `<ol>` = Ordered list (numbers)
- Used to organize content in list form.

### `<li>`

- Represents a list item inside `<ul>` or `<ol>`.
- Example:
  ```html
  <ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
  </ul>
  ```
